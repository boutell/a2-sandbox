= Pages =

Subdirectories of this folder define new page types for Apostrophe. An Apostrophe "page" is a collection of named content areas, with a title, a slug (usually), a handle (if the page is not part of a conventional page tree), and a collection of subpages (which may be empty). Subtypes of pages could include blogs and individual blog posts; a "blog" page type might act a lot like a regular page except with regard to the sort order of its subpages and the allowable page templates.
