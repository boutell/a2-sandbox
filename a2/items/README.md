Subfolders of this folder define new item types for Apostrophe. Apostrophe represents content as a series of "items" making up an "area." Item types include "text" (rich text editor), "files" (used for single images, slideshows, and other types of uploaded files presented to the user) and "video" (a single embedded video, such as a YouTube video).
